PicoScenes License Plan (PSLP) 
=======================================

License mechanism is a promising way to ensure more sustainable development of the PicoScenes system. For PicoScenes, we call it PicoScenes License Plan (PSLP). 

PSLP adopts the rolling release, *i.e.*, PSLP will be updated every two months with refined license structure, user support, *etc*. For paid license, the subscription fee will also go up.


PSLP v0.1.10
-------------------

PSLP v0.1.10 is the Nov. 2021 version of PSLP and also the first PSLP. It is simple and functional.


**TL;DR**：PSLP v0.1.10 offers **two license options, free and paid**. The former covers the most common features, and the latter provides the advanced features plus timely technical support. The subscription fee of the paid license is **8688 RMB or 1360 USD/computer/year** with an extra bulk purchase discount.

We provide a **bilingual document** which describes PSLP v0.1.10 in detail. Click here to download :download:`PSLP v0.1.10 Documentation <_static/PSLP_v0.1.10.pdf>`. The accountability for this key license document can be tracked back to `this git commit <https://gitlab.com/wifisensing/PicoScenes-Manual/-/commit/ac91c2e40fb808bbc671a9c246a264c584b02eeb>`_ of the source code of this documentation site.
