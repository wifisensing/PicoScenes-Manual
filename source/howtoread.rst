How to Read This Document
=========================

I Don't Know Chinese, How?
---------------------------

PicoScenes is a huge project, even for its documentation. In order to release PicoScenes software ASAP, we divide the documentation work into two phases:

 **Phase 1**: Chinese version + machine translation 
    A large part of documents are written in Chinese and you use Chrome or Safari browser to machine translate the documents.
    The Chinese document is concise and clear, which helps deliver better machine translation.

 **Phase 2**: High-quality documents in both Chinese and English
    All documents will be translated into English in the near future.
