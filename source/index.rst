Welcome to PicoScenes's documentation!
========================================

PicoScenes software is an advanced Wi-Fi sensing platform. It supports multi-NIC concurrent CSI measurement for Qualcomm Atheros AR9300 (QCA930), Intel Wireless Link 5300 (IWL5300) and software-defined radio (SDR) devices. For QCA9300, PicoScenes unlocks the arbitrary tuning for both the carrier frequency (a total of 2.4 GHz spectrum in 2.4 and 5 GHz bands) and baseband sampling rate (from 2.5 to 80 MHz). For SDR, PicoScenes embeds a high-performance software implementation for 802.11a/g/n/ac/ax baseband with up to 4x4 multi-user (MU)-MIMO support. PicoScenes is also architecturally versatile and flexible.
