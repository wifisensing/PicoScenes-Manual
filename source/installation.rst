Hardware Installation
=======================

PicoScenes currently supports two commercial Wi-Fi NIC models, the QCA9300 and IWL5300, two USRP models, the N210 and X310 models. For other USRP models, such as the B200/E300/N300 series, PicoScenes *should* be able to support them. However, the incompatibility caused by hardware variations is possible.

One of the most welcomed features of the PicoScenes is the concurrent operation of multiple RF frontends, i.e., simultaneous CSI measurement or packet injection on a NIC or SDR array. To help you get the hardware ready quickly, we share our hardware preparation experience, mainly focusing on the multi-devices setup.

Installation for (Multiple) QCA9300 or IWL5300 NICs
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We recommend three multi-NIC installation methods.

Mini PCI-E to PCI-E 1x adapter-based multi-NIC installation
    With the help of the Mini PCI-E to PCI-E 1x adapter, you can install the QCA9300 and IWL5300 directly on the motherboard. 

    However, although the motherboard typically offers 4-6 PCI-E slots, the number of PCI-E slots remaining is less than 3 because the graphic card, attached NVMe board, or 10GbE ethernet may occupy 2 or 3 slots.

    To overcome this issue, you may choose the motherboard primarily designed for cryptocurrency mining, such as MSI B360-F Pro. These motherboards have more than a dozen of PCI-E 1x slots, and you can use *PCI-E slot riser* to install a Wi-Fi NIC for each of them.

Multi-Mini PCI-E slots-based multi-NIC installation
    This is the most convenient multi-NIC installation approach. Multiple onboard Mini PCI-E slots spare the need for Mini PCI-E to PCI-E 1x adaptors and also present a highly compact factor. 
    There are many Intel NUC models equipped with two Mini PCI-E slots. However, it is troublesome always to connect a power cable; after all, they are not laptops
    
    Pursuing a wire-free multi-NIC solution, we recommend ThinkPad X201. Despite a ten-year-old laptop model, its motherboard provided two full/half-height Mini PCI-E slots, and we can install the QCA9300 or IWL5300 NICs in both of them.

    Even better, **X201 enables you to install three SMA-based external antennas!** The FPC-connected daughter board of X201, which accounts for Modem, audio In/Out and a USB port, can be safely removed, leaving three size compatible holes for installing SMA external antennas. The following photo shows our modified ThinkPad X201 equipped with both the QCA9300 and IWl5300 and three external antennas.

    .. warning::
        The official BIOS of ThinkPad X201 forbids changing Wi-Fi NIC. Before changing or adding another Wi-Fi NIC, you may have to flash the modified BIOS, which white-lists the 3rd-party and the second Wi-Fi NICs. You may visit https://zpj.io/replace-install-nics-for-thinkpad-x201/ for assistance (A Chinese document, machine translation may be required).

PCI-E bridge adapter-based multi-NIC installation
    The PCI-E bridge adapter can split one PCI-E connection into multiple, just like a PCI-E hub. Therefore, you may install connect multiple NICs to only one of the motherboard PCI-E slots via the bridge adapter.

    And even more so, you may build a multi-layer hierarchy of the bridge adapters and install QCA9300 or IWL5300 to all its leaf nodes. In this way, you may install over 100 Wi-Fi NICs to your system in theory. To validate the feasibility of this approach, we built a 27-NIC Wi-Fi sensing array using a 3-layer hierarchy of the 1 to 3 PCI-E bridge adapters. The figure below shows the picture and layout of the 27-NIC array. The entire array is encapsulated in an IKEA box.

Installation for (Multiple) USRP N210 and X310
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Follow the official manual:
    PicoScenesâ€™s support for USRP devices is established upon UHD software, the USRP hardware driver. Therefore, you should first set up your hardware/software according to the official   `USRP Hardware Driver and USRP Manual <https://files.ettus.com/manual/index.html>`_. For N210 and X310 models, you should read the following three documents carefully:

    - `Multiple USRP configuration <https://files.ettus.com/manual/page_multiple.html>`_
    - `USRP Hardware Driver and USRP Manual: USRP2 and N2x0 Series <https://files.ettus.com/manual/page_usrp2.html>`_
    - `USRP Hardware Driver and USRP Manual: USRP X3x0 Series <https://files.ettus.com/manual/page_usrp_x3x0.html>`_

Some advices base on our experience:
    - For X310, **don't use the PCI-E cable-based connection**. Besides the notably expensive cables, it has two main drawbacks. First, the PCI-E-based connection is inefficient in that each link can only connect one X310; therefore multi-X310 connection requires you to install multiple PCI-E extension boards, which is very expensive and is even impossible for a regular desktop PC with few spare PCI-E slots. Second, the UHD software doesn't support the hybrid combination of the PCI-E-based link and the GbE/10GbE-based link. This restriction further devalues the PCI-E-based link.
    - For both N210/X310, **we recommend Intel X710 Quad Port 10 Gb Ethernet Adapter**, a reasonable and cost-effective solution for multiple N210 and X310 connections. It occupies only one full-size PCI-E slot but provides four 10GbE ports, allowing you to drive up to 4 X310s or eight independent full-duplex channels.
    - For both the N210 and X310, please consider using the UBX-40/UBX-160 daughterboard first. UBX-40 and UBX-160, though expensive, are the only full-duplex daughterboards that support daughterboard-level phase synchronization. And only with this level of synchronization, can you realize the phased-array functionality.
    - Please pay special attention to the allocation of IP addresses. For network-based connections, the NIC port and the connected USRP must be in the same subnet. However, if they are not in the same subnet, the UHD device discovery program *udh_find_devices* can still find the devices, but PicoScenes cannot initialize the device correctly.
    - For N210, MIMO cable is an easy way to achieve MIMO and phased array, except for its narrow bandwidth.
    - For clock distribution, OctoClock-G is a cost-effective choice that distributes the GPS-disciplined clocks to up to eight USRPs.

PicoScenes Installation
=========================

Prerequisites
++++++++++++++++++++

- Operating System: PicoScenes **only** supports Ubuntu 20.04 or its variants (Linux Mint, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, etc)
- Internet connection: internet connection is required throughout the installation process, and **is also required periodically for license checking** during the later use.
- Latest kernel version: PicoScenes depends on and is also built against the latest kernel version, your system have to be updated to the *latest* kernel version. Fortunately, *you don't have to update your system manually*, because PicoScenes installer will trigger the kernel update routine automatically.
- Latest MATLAB on Linux/macOS: PicoScenes MATLAB Toolbox, which decodes the CSI measurement data in MATLAB, **only** supports the latest MATLAB on Linux/macOS platforms (R2020b or R2021a).
    
    .. note::
        The porting of PicoScenes MATLAB Toolbox to Windows platform is on the way.

Install PicoScenes
++++++++++++++++++++

If your system satisfies the above requirements, you can now start the installation.

- Download and install PicoScenes Source Updater
    - Download PicoScenes Source Updater by clicking :download:`PicoScenes <https://zpj.io/PicoScenes/pool/main/picoscenes-source-updater.deb>`
    
    - Start the installer by double-clicking and then click `Install Package`

- Update your system apt repository cache and install PicoScenes
    Open a terminal and run the following command
    
    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo apt update

- Install PicoScenes packages
    In the same terminal (or open a new one) and run the following command
        
    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo apt install picoscenes-all

    After a minute of package downloading (the duration depends on your network), a EULA message, similar to the following screenshot, will appear in the terminal. You should read the EULA, and decide if you agree to the EULA terms. You can press up/down arrow keys to view the full content and press TAB to move the cursor to the <Ok>. You finish the reading by pressing Enter or Space on <Ok> button.

        Screenshot: User decides whether to accept the EULA terms

    .. hint:: If you wrongfully press <No>, PicoScenes installer will show you the solution to reinitialize the installation.
        
- Reboot your system
    You will have to reboot your system to validate the installation, otherwise the modified drivers for QCA9300 and IWL5300 will not be activated.

- The first run
    The installation of PicoScenes is almost finished except one last step. 
    You should run ``PicoScenes`` in a terminal (case sensitive), which is your first time opening PicoScenes.
    During the first launch, PicoScenes will pop an error saying that "This is a scheduled exception ...". 
    Yes, it is indeed a scheduled exception.

    Run ``PicoScenes`` in the terminal again, and the error should be gone.
    Until now, PicoScenes is successfully installed on your system.


PicoScenes MATLAB Toolbox Installation
========================================

Download PicoScenes MATLAB Toolbox
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Once PicoScenes is successfully installed, a bash script is provided to download the latest PicoScenes MATLAB Toolbox. Open a terminal and run the following command:
        
    .. code-block:: bash

        download_matlab_toolbox

The script will download the PicoScenes MATLAB Toolbox archive file ``PicoScenes-MATLAB-Toolbox.tar.gz`` to your *present working directory (pwd)*. You may unzip it to you ``${HOME}`` by GUI file explorer or by command ``tar -zxf PicoScenes-MATLAB-Toolbox.tar.gz ~``.

Install PicoScenes MATLAB Toolbox (in MATLAB)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Open MATLAB, change `Current Folder` to the unzipped ``PicoScenes-MATLAB-Toolbox`` directory and run the following command in MATLAB Command Window:

    .. code-block:: matlab

        install_PicoScenes_MATLAB_Toolbox

In a few seconds, seeing similar messages shown in the picture below means that you have successfully installed the PicoScenes MATLAB Toolbox.

    .. figure:: /images/install-PicoScenes-MATLAB-Toolbox.png

Verifying the Installation
============================


Verify the hardware installation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- For QCA9300/IWL5300 NICs: use array_status
    Open a terminal and run the following command
    
    .. code-block:: bash

            array_status
    
    `array_status` is a bash script installed by PicoScenes. It lists all the installed Wi-Fi NICs (except Wi-Fi USB dongles). You should check whether all the installed Wi-Fi NICs are shown in the list. If a Wi-Fi NIC is not shown in the list, it will also not be discovered or controlled by PicoScenes.

- For USRP N210/X310 series:
    Before using the USRP devices, first check whether the devices can work normally.
    
    Open a terminal and run the following command

    Discover the device

    .. code-block:: bash

            udh_find_devices

    `udh_find_devices` is the device discovery program provided by UHD. It will lists all the found devices. If a USRP is not shown in the list, it will also not be discovered or controlled by PicoScenes.

    .. code-block:: bash

            uhd_usrp_probe

    `uhd_usrp_probe` can check whether the firmware of the device is consistent with the UHD version installed on the PC.

    If the versions are inconsistent, you need to burn new firmware for USRP:

    If you are using a USRP N210 device:

    .. code-block:: bash

        uhd_image_loader --args=type=usrp2

    If you are using a USRP X310 device:

    .. code-block:: bash

        uhd_image_loader --args=type=x300

    Check whether you can receive the signal    

    .. code-block:: bash

        uhd_fft --args="addr=192.168.30.2" -f 2200e6

    In `uhd_fft`,you should fill in the `addr` parameter according to your device address.

    Finally, execute the following three commands in sequence to make the device run completely once,this process may take a few minutes.

    .. code-block:: bash

        uhd_cal_rx_iq_balance
        uhd_cal_tx_dc_offset
        uhd_cal_tx_iq_balance

    If the above three commands can run successfully, the device can work normally, otherwise, you need to check the specific problems of the device.

Verify the PicoScenes installation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Open a terminal and run `PicoScenes` again. If everything goes fine, you will see some booting messages of PicoScenes, including how many COTS NICs are found, how many USRPs are found and how many plugin are found.

As PicoScenes is designed to be a `service` program, it will not quit automatically. You can press Ctrl+C to exit PicoScenes.


Verify the PicoScenes MATLAB Toolbox installation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In MATLAB `Current Folder` or system file explorer, navigate to ``PicoScenes-MATLAB-Toolbox/samples`` directory, **draw-n-drop** the two sample .csi files into Command Window.  If GCC is correctly installed, PicoScenes MATLAB Toolbox will compile the MATLAB MEX-based .csi file parser during the first time use. 
The compilation may take tens of seconds. If the compilation is successfully, two samples files samples_9300.csi and samples_x310.csi will be parsed into cell arrays named ``samples_9300`` and ``samples_x310``, respectively.


Performance Tuning (for Heavy SDR User)
=========================================

If your research depends heavily on SDR, the following two system-level performance tunings can yield substantial performance improvements.

- Disable Hyper-threading
    The PicoScenes's Wi-Fi baseband implementation is *currently* a single-threaded processing flow, thus its performance highly depends on the single-core CPU performance. Disabling hyper-threading can provide roughly 10% increase in total throughout. There is usually an option in BIOS to disable it.

- Disable Spectre/Meltdown vulnerability protection
    **If you are in absolute safe environment**, disabling this vulnerability protection can improve the performance of the speculative execution and the overall throughput.

    This can be done by replacing the default ``GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT='...'`` line with the following line in your ``/etc/default/grub`` file. Modifying this file requires root privilege.
    
    .. code-block:: bash

        GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="pti=off spectre_v2=off l1tf=off nospec_store_bypass_disable no_stf_barrier"
