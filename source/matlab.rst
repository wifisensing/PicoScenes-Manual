PicoScenes MATLAB Toolbox
===================================

PicoScenes MATLAB Toolbox (PMT) enables MATLAB to parse the '.csi' file generated by PicoScenes.

Obtaining PMT
-----------------------------------------
You can git clone or download the PMT from its independent git repo `PicoScenes MATLAB Toolbox Core <https://gitlab.com/wifisensing/PicoScenes-MATLAB-Toolbox-Core>`_.

Usage
-------------------
You have three ways to parse a .csi file:

    #. Double-click the selected .csi file in MATLAB Current Folder;
    #. Drag'n'Drop one or multiple .csi files into MATLAB Command Window;
    #. run ``opencsi(FILE_PATH)`` in MATLAB Command Window, where `FILE_PATH` is the path to the selected .csi file.

After parsing, you will see bundles with the same names as the .csi files in MATLAB Workspace.

Structures of the PicoScenes Tx and Rx frames

        PicoScenes Tx/Rx Frame Structure


Figure :ref:`framestructure` shows the Tx and Rx frame structures adopted by PicoScenes. PicoScenes frames consists of multiple `PicoScenes Segments` (segment). Each segment is a name- and version-labelled container that holds heterogenous data structure or content.

The PMT parses the .csi files in two stages, the Raw Parsing and Bundled Parsing. 
    - The Raw Parsing: PMT first parses the per-CSI measurement into a MATLAB `cell`. If a .csi file contains :math:`N` CSI measurements, the Raw Parsing will produce a measurement cell array with :math:`N` elements. This parsing level is mandatory for next-level processing. However, CSI measurements being separated in MATLAB cells is apparently not convenient for further analysis.
    - The Bundled Parsing: To overcome the inconveniences of the Raw Parsing, PMT tries to merge the cells into a unified structure--much easier for analysis. However, the merging may fail if the internal data structures are different across all measurements.

In the following, we introduce the data structures of the Raw Parsing stage. 

Data structures of the Raw Parsing
------------------------------------

Each cell of the Raw Parsing result contains the following items. You may click the links on the left to view its detailed structure.
