PicoScenes Installation
========================


Hardware Installation
---------------------

PicoScenes currently supports two Wi-Fi NIC models, the QCA9300 and IWL5300, and two USRP models, the N210 and X310 models. These devices have been extensively tested during the development. For other USRP models, such as B200 or E300 series, PicoScenes *should* be able to support them. However, the incompatibility caused by hardware differences is possible.
