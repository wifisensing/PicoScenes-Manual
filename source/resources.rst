The academic paper of PicoScenes
------------------------------------

Zhiping Jiang, Tom H. Luan, Xincheng Ren, Dongtao Lv, Han Hao, Jing Wang, Kun Zhao, Wei Xi, Yueshen Xu, Rui Li, `Eliminating the Barriers: Demystifying Wi-Fi Baseband Design and Introducing the PicoScenes Wi-Fi Sensing Platform`, `preprint on arxiv <https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10233>`_.

This paper introduces PicoScenes and also reports very extensive performance evaluations of PicoScenes. Many of the results are state of the art.

.. important:: If PicoScenes software (including the main program, bash scripts, PicoScenes MATLAB Toolbox and any PicoScenes plugins regardless of the ownership) is used by any form in your academic research, **you should cite the above work**. This citation requirement is also included in the PicoScenes Software EULA.

Project repositories
----------------------------

- PicoScenes projects group: https://gitlab.com/wifisensing. The following are some of the open source sub-projects.
    - `RXS Parsing Core <https://gitlab.com/wifisensing/rxs_parsing_core>`_: the core CSI data parsing routine and the related utility code. This project is shared between the PicoScenes main program and PicoScenes MATLAB Toolbox via git submodule.
    - `PicoScenes Plugin Development Kit (PS-PDK) <https://gitlab.com/wifisensing/PicoScenes-PDK>`_: the source repositories of three PicoScenes plugins, namely the Demo Plugin, UDP Forwarder and EchoProbe. We name it PS-PDK, because most PicoScenes plugins are developed based on this repo. 
    - `PicoScenes Manual <https://gitlab.com/wifisensing/PicoScenes-Manual>`_: the reStructuredText source code of this documentation.
